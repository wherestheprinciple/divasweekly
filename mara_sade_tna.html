    <h2>Mara Sadè Talks Who Inspired Her To Join TNA</h2>
    <h3>By Nick Wilkinson | September 1, 2025 </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Mara Sadè has found a new home in TNA as one of its newest Knockouts. So far she has entered into a feud with Tasha Steelz.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sadè spoke recently with The Wrestling Classic in regards to her choice of TNA as her new home.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>“To be honest, there are options, most certainly, but legends have come from TNA. For example, Chelsea, Naomi, like these people have gone through TNA, and they were able to expand and show who they were, and that’s inspiring to me, and I want to do the same. I feel like the creative freedom is there, television is there; I’m back on people’s screens, which I know everybody’s been wanting. So we back. But like you said, there are options. But this one felt like the right one.”</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Sadè previously performed in WWE on its NXT brand as Jakara Jackson. She was one-half of the Meta Girls with Lash Legend. She had crossed over to TNA prior to her WWE release.</p>
