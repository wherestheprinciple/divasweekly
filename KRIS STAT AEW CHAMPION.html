    <h2>Kris Statlander Dethrones Toni Storm To Become New AEW Women’s Champion</h2>
    <h3>By Nick Wilkinson | September 20, 2025  </h3>
    <br>
    <p>The Timeless one has been dethroned at AEW’s All Out as Storm has lost the AEW Women’s World Championship in a four way bout. The match also included Jamie Hayter and Thekla. This ends Storm record setting fourth reign at 217 days. She had six successful title defenses in this reign as she defeated the likes of Athena and Mercedes Moné.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The final moments of the match had Thekla spearing Hayter off the ring apron to take both women out of the equation. Statlander would surprise Storm with a roll through to get the pin.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This marks Statlander’s first time as champion and the tenth woman to hold the gold since its inception in 2019. She is a previous TBS Champion.</p>
