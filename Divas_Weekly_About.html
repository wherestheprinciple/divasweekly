      <h3>Why did I make Divas Weekly?</h3>
      <br>
      <p>"Growing up, my perception of pro-wrestling was that it was a male dominated industry, and in a way, it was and honestly still is. </p>
      <br>
      <p>One night in 2013, at my grandparents' house, I was bored and flipping through channels on the TV, trying to find something entertaining to watch. I randomly stumbled upon an episode of SmackDown that featured AJ Lee.</p>
      <br>
      <p>She wasn't a cheerful super-hero type like John Cena or a creepy entity like The Undertaker. She's quite small, likes to wear pink, and for the lack of a better word, nerdy. She didn't even fit the mold of what a Diva (WWE women's wrestler) was supposed to be. Yet every time she steps in the ring, she delivers banger after banger matches with even more banger moments on the mic. She oozed natural charisma and made the women’s division worth watching at a time when women’s wrestling was considered to be "toilet breaks" for the shows. </p>
      <br>
      <p>After AJ Lee, I continued to watch the women’s division grow stronger as the years go by and prove that they are just as good, if not better than the men. </p>
      <br>
      <p>This site was made with women’s wrestling fans like myself in mind. There aren't many platforms that exclusively talk about women’s wrestling, and I would like to help change that and bring women’s wrestling to the forefront of the pro-wrestling industry."</p>
