    <h2>Layla Talks Current Talent: “I’m So Happy For All These Women”</h2>
    <h3>By Nick Wilkinson | September 9, 2025 </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Former WWE Divas and Women’s Champion Layla was at the recent WrestleCon in August. Fightful caught up with Layla and had a chat about the current state of women’s wrestling.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>“I’d say women’s wrestling now is like, is it real? Like, I want to pinch myself sometimes. Like, ‘Wait, what?’ It’s great. I’m so happy for all these women. I’m happy that they’re able to attain and they’re able to represent for us and show us that women can do it. Women can be like the men. In our Diva era, it was always more about the sex appeal or the eye candy and stuff like that. To see women out there in like main event, it’s amazing and I hope that in 10 years the women who are current now are going to be looking and saying like, ‘Wow, women have taken over.’”</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Layla has generally stayed out of the wrestling world since her retirement in 2015. However, the former champion has mentioned she wouldn’t be opposed to having another match with her LayCool partner, Michelle McCool.</p>
