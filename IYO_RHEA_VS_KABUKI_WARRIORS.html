    <h2>Tag Team Match Added To Crown Jewel Perth</h2>
    <h3>By Nick Wilkinson | September 29, 2025 </h3>
    <br>
    <p>IYO SKY and Rhea Ripley will be taking on the Kabuki Warriors on Oct. 11 in Perth, Australia.</p>
    <br>
    <p>SKY has had enough of Asuka’s antics and considers Kairi Sane lost in the mix. To start off the Sept. 29 episode of Raw, Rhea Ripley was trying to explain to SKY about Asuka and Sane’s betrayal last week. Ripley was trying to convince her to trust her but SKY said she needed time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As SKY left the ring, The Kabuki Warriors attacked Ripley causing more conflict in the mind of SKY. Sane would try and convince SKY to still be with them, but Asuka had other plans as she misted SKY in the face.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Later on, Sane approached SKY backstage and tried to encourage her to apologize to Asuka and it wasn’t too late, that they could still be a family. SKY wasn’t interested in apologizing. Instead she would get a match booked for Crown Jewel.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When SKY tells Ripley about the match, Ripley is hesitant because she wants to make sure she can trust SKY. SKY says she can trust her.</p>
