    <h2>AJ Lee returns to WWE after 10-year absence</h2>
    <h3>By Ryan Gaydos  | September 6, 2025 </h3>
    <br>
    <p>AJ Lee made her long-awaited return to the WWE on Friday night.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lee appeared on "Friday Night SmackDown" to provide some backup for her real-life husband, CM Punk, as his feud with Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch exploded over the last week. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Lynch cost Punk the World Heavyweight Championship at Clash in Paris last weekend and then berated him during a segment on "Monday Night Raw" earlier this week. Punk teased that he had something up his sleeve going into Friday’s show.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Punk and Lynch addressed each other in the ring.</p>
    <br>
    <p>"Becky, this is exactly the situation I wanted to avoid," he said, "because you know and I know and everyone knows, I would never put my hands on a lady. Thankfully, I got somebody who will."</p>
    <br>
    <p>Punk turned around and Lee’s entrance music hit. The fans in Chicago were thrown into a frenzy. Lynch was stunned as Lee made her way down to the ring.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lee has not been seen in the WWE since she retired in April 2015. It was more than a year after Punk controversially left the company. Lee was involved in Women of Wrestling, a Jeanie Buss-backed promotion, but didn’t return to in-ring action.</p>
