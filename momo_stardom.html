    <h2>Momo Watanabe Wins STARDOM 2025 5Star Grand Prix</h2>
    <h3>By Nick Wilkinson | August 23, 2025 </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Momo Watanabe is your STARDOM 2025 5Star Grand Prix winner. On Aug. 23 she defeated the current NJPW STRONG Women’s Champion AZM in the tournament finals. Leading to the finals, Watanabe defeated Saori Anou int he semi-finals, while AZM took out Rina. Watanabe and AZM are former tag team partners and former members of Queen Quest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This win for Watanabe was a long time coming as in 2021’s finals for the 5 Star GP she lost to Syrui. This win will give Watanabe a shot at the top title in Stardom, the red belt, the World of Stardom Championship. The title is currently held by Saya Kamitani, who will be challenged by Bea Priestley next. Watanabe is highly decorated in STARDOM including holding the Wonder of Stardom Title for nearly a year at 358 days, but the 25 year old has not held the top title…yet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Also at the event on Aug. 23, Sareee defended the NJPW IWGP Women’s Title against Konami. She retained.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Future of Stardom Title was on the line as well, with Hina retaining against Ranna Yagami.</p>
