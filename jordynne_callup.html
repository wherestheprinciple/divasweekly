    <h2>Report: Jordynne Grace’s Call Up Still “In The Works”</h2>
    <h3>By Nick Wilkinson | September 13, 2025 </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Jordynne Grace signed with WWE in January of this year after wrapping up a near seven year career with TNA. Although she could have fit very well right into the main roster of WWE, she has found herself in NXT since her official debut in the 2025 Royal Rumble match.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So when will Grace be called up? A former three-time TNA Knockouts World Champion shouldn’t have much problem transitioning to the main roster. She has recently been in a highly intense feud with Blake Monroe (another talent who could have went right to the main roster) which seems to be leading to a stipulation match.</p>
    <br>
    <p>According to a report by BodyslamNet, here’s the most recent on Grace.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>WWE still “fully intends” to call Jordynne Grace up to the main roster.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>However, the timeline for Grace’s call-up was pushed back earlier this year, and sources indicate that it is not imminent but is still in the works.</b></p>
