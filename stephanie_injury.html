    <h2>Stephanie Vaquer Shuts Down Injury Rumors</h2>
    <h3>By Nick Wilkinson | September 11, 2025 </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Stephanie Vaquer is set to face IYO SKY for the vacant Women’s World Title on Sept. 20 at Wrestlepalooza. Her whereabouts from this past Monday’s Raw were in question when the contract signing segment was canceled. She then showed up on NXT the following night leading to more speculation by fans and dirt sheets. Of course there could have always been some travel issues to get Vaquer to Raw’s location, but from Vaquer herself we know she is not injured.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In an interview with Adrian Hernandez, Vaquer stated:</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>“No, I saw social media. Sometimes, many things are not real. There’s no injuries. I’m ready for Raw next Monday.”</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Vaquer is also booked for NXT on Tuesday to team with Tiffany Stratton and Rhea Ripley. They will be taking on Fatal Influence at NXT Homecoming.</p>
